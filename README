Symta is a novel dialect of Lisp programming language. Symta features succinct syntax, geared towards list-processing, and innovative approach to memory management, without requiring pause-inducing garbage collection or manual deallocation.

See doc/symta-by-example.md for a quick introduction to the language.


To produce compiler do "bash build.sh". Currently Symta needs GCC to function correctly. It was tested with gcc-4.2. Newer GCCs are known to fail.

`bsrenew` renews compiler's C files (needs SBCL), in case you do any changes to files udner src/ or pkg/symta/src
